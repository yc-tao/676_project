Classic mining (Apriori / frequent itemsets) is usually **not the point** and is likely infeasible/unhelpful at this scale; feasible approaches are **sequential models** (transformers), plus **retrieval/candidate sampling** for next-item tasks. QA-style evaluation is feasible because targets are auto-generated from logs. | **Exposure / popularity bias** (popular items get more clicks), **feedback-loop bias** (recommendations influence future clicks), potential **demographic bias** depending on what user attributes exist/are used, and **domain bias** (Taobao behaviors may not generalize). | Even if anonymized, personalization modeling can risk **privacy leakage** or behavior-based re-identification; also risk of **manipulative targeting**. Power dynamic: platform/merchant vs. consumer; personalization can shift outcomes without user awareness. |\n",
    "| **SatHealth** | **Multimodal spatiotemporal public-health mining**: (i) **Regional public health modeling** (predict **SDI** and **disease prevalence** from environment), (ii) **Personal disease risk prediction** enhanced by environmental embeddings. | **Spatial/temporal misalignment** across sources (monthly climate vs yearly prevalence; imagery without aligned timestamps), **measurement error** (remote sensing proxies), **aggregation bias** (county/ZCTA/CBSA smoothing hides within-region heterogeneity). | Data is large but manageable with modern ML: multimodal feature extraction + regression/classification. Traditional Apriori/sequential pattern mining is less relevant; feasible tasks are **representation learning**, **spatiotemporal prediction**, and **association analysis** with appropriate controls. | **Sampling bias** from claims/EHR sources (insured populations; coding practices), **urban–rural confounding**, **SES confounding** (environment correlates with access and income), and **spatial confounding** (policies/healthcare availability). | Potential harms: **stigmatization** of regions, **resource allocation** decisions that disadvantage communities, and **privacy** risk if linked too granularly.

Classic graph algorithms (centrality, random walks) are feasible; fairness constraints add overhead but remain feasible. | **Historical/structural bias** baked into labels (credit, bail/recidivism), **network/visibility bias** (who connects to whom), and **representation bias** if some groups are underrepresented or less connected, which can reduce model performance and worsen disparities. | High-stakes domains (finance, criminal justice) increase harm risk: unfair predictions can affect livelihoods/freedom.

    "### Why SatHealth\n",
    "Primary reason (fit to my interests):\n",
    "- My research focus is machine learning for healthcare, and SatHealth directly targets public health and disease risk modeling using real-world environmental signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Favorable dataset characteristics:\n",
    "- Clear, high-impact targets: supports predicting social determinants of health (SDI) and disease prevalence/risk, which are meaningful and interpretable healthcare outcomes.\n",
    "- Multimodal + spatiotemporal structure: combines satellite imagery with environmental variables (e.g., climate/weather) and health outcomes, enabling both classic data mining (associations across regions/time) and modern ML (multimodal representation learning).\n",
    "- Multiple granularities of analysis: enables regional-level analyses (population health) and individual-level risk modeling (personal health), useful for comparing modeling assumptions and evaluation setups.\n",
    "- Natural avenues for methodological comparison: easy to compare\n",
    "  - unimodal vs multimodal models (imagery-only vs environment-only vs fused),\n",
    "  - static vs temporal models (single snapshot vs sequences),\n",
    "  - predictive modeling vs descriptive mining (prediction vs interpretable drivers).\n",
    "- Practical relevance and coherent narrative: environmental exposure → health outcomes is a defensible story for a report and supports insights beyond benchmark scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I can mine / analyze with it\n",
    "- Clustering / regional stratification: group regions by environmental signatures and relate clusters to SDI / prevalence.\n",
    "- Anomaly detection: identify regions/time periods with unusual divergence between environmental signals and observed prevalence.\n",
    "- Spatiotemporal prediction: forecast prevalence/SDI trends using lagged environmental variables.\n",
    "- Representation learning: learn embeddings from imagery + environment, then test whether embeddings improve downstream health prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs (vs other candidate datasets)\n",
    "Compared to UQABench (e-commerce click logs):\n",
    "- Pros of SatHealth: directly healthcare-relevant; outcomes are societally meaningful; easier to justify in a healthcare ML report.\n",
    "- Cons of SatHealth: weaker support for classic course topics like frequent itemsets and association rules; less naturally aligned with sequential pattern mining.\n",
    "- What I lose by not choosing UQABench: a clean setup for sequential behavior modeling (next-action prediction, sequential patterns) and extremely large-scale interaction logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to fairness-focused graph benchmarks (credit/recidivism/social graphs):\n",
    "- Pros of SatHealth: centered on health outcomes rather than adjudication labels (credit/bail); multimodal rather than purely relational; can study environment-driven health disparities.\n",
    "- Cons of SatHealth: fairness analysis is less “off-the-shelf” because protected groups may not be explicitly represented; requires careful definition of groups and fairness metrics.\n",
    "- What I lose by not choosing graph benchmarks: standardized fairness tasks, sensitive attributes, and established fairness baselines/metrics for direct comparison."

    "Observation: Environmental tables (airquality, climate, greenery) are county-level panels with 7,392 rows, consistent with 88 counties × 7 years × 12 months.\n",
    "Hypothesis: Temporal dynamics and seasonality will be strong drivers; models that ignore time (static averages) will underperform and may misattribute effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: Missingness is concentrated in a few variables: NDVI is missing ~49%, NDVI_binary ~32%, and NO2 ~36%, while most climate variables appear complete.\n",
    "Hypothesis: Naive row-wise deletion will disproportionately remove greener/remote or cloud-prone observations and bias downstream associations; robust imputation or modeling missingness explicitly will be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: Several airquality variables are uninformative in the current extract (PM2.5 is all zeros), and some variables have very limited variance (NO2 values clustered tightly).\n",
    "Hypothesis: Some features may be preprocessing artifacts or unit/scale issues; feature validation and variance-based filtering will materially improve model stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: Climate features are highly correlated (e.g., latent heat flux vs total evaporation ~1.0; temperature vs soil temperature ~0.996; radiation sums tightly correlated).\n",
    "Hypothesis: Multicollinearity will inflate coefficients and reduce interpretability in linear models; dimensionality reduction (PCA) or regularization (ridge/lasso) or targeted feature selection will be needed for interpretable inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: Landcover and SDI are cross-sectional at the county level (88 rows), while disease prevalence is at CBSA level (47 units) with time (1,969 rows).\n",
    "Hypothesis: Mismatched geographic scales (CBSA vs county) will be a key bottleneck; analysis must either harmonize to a common geography or use hierarchical/multi-level approaches to avoid ecological fallacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: Disease prevalence shows large differences across ICD-10 level-1 codes (e.g., Z00-Z99 and R00-R99 much higher than many others).\n",
    "Hypothesis: Broad ICD group prevalence may reflect healthcare utilization and coding practices as much as underlying disease burden; focusing on a subset of clinically grounded categories (e.g., cardio/metabolic/respiratory) may yield cleaner signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: Google Map points are very large (432,918 points) and link to 88 counties; this is the main high-volume modality compared to the tabular panels.\n",
    "Hypothesis: Imagery-derived embeddings may add value beyond climate/airquality, but computational cost will be dominated by image feature extraction; sampling strategies or precomputed embeddings will be important for feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential RQs:\n",
    "- How does handling missingness (imputation vs missing-indicator vs model-based) change estimated relationships between greenery (NDVI) and disease prevalence/SDI?\n",
    "- Do temporal models (lagged climate/airquality, seasonal terms) outperform static annual averages for predicting prevalence and SDI?\n",
    "- Which feature sets contribute most: climate-only vs airquality-only vs greenery-only vs landcover+SDI vs multimodal fusion including imagery embeddings?\n",
    "- How robust are associations to multicollinearity controls (regularization vs PCA vs manual feature pruning based on correlation)?\n",
    "- What is the impact of geographic harmonization choice (county aggregation to CBSA vs CBSA disaggregation assumptions) on conclusions about environment–health links?\n",
    "- Are there detectable “outlier” counties/years where prevalence deviates from what environmental variables would predict, suggesting unmeasured drivers (access, policy, coding)?"
